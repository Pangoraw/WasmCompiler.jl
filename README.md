# WasmCompiler.jl

This is essentially a rewrite of [Charlotte.jl](https://github.com/MikeInnes/Charlotte.jl) (a lot has changed since 2018, both in WebAssembly and Julia land) targeting the new WebAssembly proposals ([gc](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc),[exceptions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling),...).
